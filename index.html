  <h1> My Mission </h1>
  <p> <b>I love building things that people love to use.</b> Ever since I was a teenager, I knew that any software I built would have the foremost purpose of making people's lives better. As a kid, that was making my friends an awesome new Counter Strike server on Linux, or running a phpBB roleplaying forum with hundreds of active members. As an adult, it's been contributing to the decentralized Web3 ecosystem that I believe will change the internet forever, and give people more control over their digital/real lives. My work experience has been with major companies that have given me an eye-opening view of what goes into building resilient infrastructure, elegant software, and top-notch teams. I'm thankful for the opportunities I've had thus far and everything I've learned about software architecture, design patterns, modern CI/CD deployment, algorithmic thinking, and large organization coordination. With those lessons, I am excited to start help building the future of software. </p>

    <h3> Bogged.me </h3>
    <p>I led a duo of my friend and I during GMU's PatriotHacks 2021 winter hackathon. We ended up winning with our Flask and MongoDB based paper trading app for cryptocurrency. I was able to take 2 weeks to learn how to build a full-fledged web application, use Bootstrap and Javascript for the first time, and implement several different APIs to get real-time price tracking and transaction information for our app. It was a great experience, and I ended up launching our application on Heroku available today (however it is still very much a work-in-progress due to being a Hackathon project).</p>

    <h3> Future dApp </h3>
    <p>I'm in the beginning stages of architecting and developing a new dApp using Geth (go-ethereum) to get more familiar with the Web3 ecosystem. Possibly touching IPFS as well as the Ethereum blockchain using ERC-20 tokenization. I am closely following the progress of the Merge/Eth2.0 as it will implement Proof of Stake and drastically reudce gas fees/environmental costs.</p>
